Experimenting with R and time series

### Introduction to Statistical Learning -- Getting Started

If you are looking to follow along with the "Introduction to Statistical Learning" class...

* typing `make` in the directory will download both this book and the author's 'Elements of Statistical Learning' into the papers directory
* You should install R and R-Studio
* Once you have done that, from within R-Studio
    * ensure you're in this directory: (`setwd` and `getwd` set and get the current directory)
    * run `source("islr-quickstart.R")`. Currently all this does is load the ISLR package, which has all the datasets referred to in the book in it.
    * There's lots of help available. There's a video introduction in the course itself, but the R distribution also comes with a huge amount of embedded help, and R-Studio has a help pane where you can browse it all. The main page has a link to 'An Introduction to R' which is probably the right starting place.
